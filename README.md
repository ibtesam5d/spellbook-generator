## dnd spellbook generator

this is a personal project to create an online dungeons and dragons spellbook generator. this spellbook generator will allow users to create a custom spellbook that can be saved or downloaded to a pdf. this spellbook will contain a list of all the users spells, along with the details about each of those spells.
